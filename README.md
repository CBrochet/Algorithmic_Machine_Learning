# Algorithmic_Machine_Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains all the projects I did with Nino Filiu for the [Algorithmic Machine Learning Course](http://www.eurecom.fr/en/course/AML-2018Spring), (see [course repository](https://github.com/DistributedSystemsGroup/Algorithmic-Machine-Learning)) at [EURECOM](http://www.eurecom.fr/fr). The guiding thread of those projects are as follows:

1. Data cleeaning
2. Data Analysis
3. Algorithm implementation
4. Algorithm applied to dataset

## Summary
* [Building a music recommender system](https://github.com/CBrochet/Algorithmic_Machine_Learning/tree/master/Building_a_Music_Recommender_System)  - Matrix factorisation - ALS - Implicit

## Technical Aspects

We used the EURECOM cloud computing platform to work on our Notebooks. Our cluster is managed by Zoe, which is a container-based analytics-as-a-service system that Eurecom has built. Notebooks front-end run in a user-facing container, whereas Notebooks kernel run in clusters of containers. For this course, we focus on Apache Spark kernel. All of our Notebooks are configured to use Spark Python API.
